Place your images here to be used by exercise-little-lemon.html

Required file names for the exercise HTML page:

- og.jpg — used for Open Graph / social card
- hero.jpg — used in the hero image
- dish1.jpg — used for special #1
- dish2.jpg — used for special #2
- dish3.jpg — used for special #3

You can add higher-resolution files with the same names and the HTML will use them automatically.

When previewing locally, use the path `/images/<filename>` — the `public/` folder is the web root in Create React App.
